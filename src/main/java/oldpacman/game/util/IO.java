/**
 * This class handles the I/O for the controllers. It has two static methods
 * that allow controller to load files and to write those files. All these files
 * need to be in the directory 'myData': when running locally, this directory
 * needs to be at the same level as the 'src' directory. In the competition,
 * this directory should be included with the source files, at the same level.
 *
 * If you use I/O in your controller, you must make use of this class. The
 * reason for this is as follows: the competition runs differently to how the
 * software is used in a local setup. There are also security concerns to be
 * taken into account (as well as file sizes). This makes it more difficult to
 * use I/O in general and hence we provide this class for all I/O. We
 * subsequently use a different class with the same signature for the actual
 * competition so that all controllers making use of this class can read and
 * write files in the actual competition.
