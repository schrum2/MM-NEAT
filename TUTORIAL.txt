=========== GETTING STARTED ===========

This code requires Java to run, and it is recommended 
that a modern IDE is used as well (the code was originally developed 
in NetBeans IDE 7.4: https://netbeans.org/ but I have since then worked
with Eclipse without any problems). 

The main class of the project is edu.utexas.cs.nn.mmneat.MMNEAT.java,
and once the project is compiled in NetBeans, there will be
a file called MM-NEAT.jar in the "dist" directory. If you are using
Eclipse, then you will need to first export an executable jar file
with MMNEAT.java as the main class.

Once the jar file is created, the code can be launched by running 
java with the jar file and appropriate command-line arguments. 
The general form is:

java -jar dist/MM-NEAT.jar runNumber:<int> randomSeed:<int> base:<experiment directory> maxGens:<int> mu:<int> io:true netio:true task:<java class> log:<experiment string>-<evaluation method string> saveTo:<evaluation method directory>

Here is a brief description of each of these key parameters.

runNumber:	An identifying number for the experimental run. Used in directory names and filenames.
randomSeed:	Should generally be the same as runNumber. Specifies seed for random number generator.
base:		Directory that will be created to store data from all experiments to be compared.
maxGens:	Number of generations before evolution stops (alternate stop conditions can be defined).
mu:		Population size.
task:		Java class that implements the Task interface.
log:		Prefix that will be used in all filenames. Recommended format above.
saveTo:		Sub-directory within the base directory where data will be saved.

Other parameters may need to be set as well, depending on the 
type of the experiment, and whether you are ok with the default
values. All default values are listed in
edu.utexas.cs.nn.parameters.Parameters.java.

Examples of appropriate parameters to launch experiments with
are in the many Experiment files described next.

=========== EXPERIMENT FILES ===========

There are several batch files in the sub-directory "batch".
Each sub-directory with the prefix Experiments-* contains batch
files associated with experiments from either my dissertation or
from peer-reviewed publications that have used MM-NEAT since then.
In each such sub-directory there is a batch file called LAUNCHALL.bat
that you can simply double-click to launch each group of experiments  
simultaneously. This is the easiest approach to recreating experimental
results, but not necessarily the best. In some cases, the number of
experiments launching may overwhelm the memory of your machine, so you
can launch the experiments individually instead. However, for the most 
part these experiments were run on a cluster, so distributing all execution
would be best.

Below are details on research conducted with MM-NEAT, and the associated
batch files.

After running any of these experiments, you will likely want to look at the 
results. Each experiment outputs several files with the suffix "plot" that
can be loaded in gnuplot. Gnuplot is an open-source tool for plotting
scientific data, and can be downloaded at: http://www.gnuplot.info/

Gnuplot only lets you analyze the numeric data. In order to see the evolved
behavior, and to see how modular networks use their multiple modules, there
are several batch files to analyze the results of completed experiments.

=========== POST EVALUATION FILES ===========

Each batch file that starts with "post" can be used to analyze the results
of a completed experiment. Each of these batch files requires command-line
arguments in order to function properly. The specific usage of each file is
shown in comments at the top of each file. Post-evaluation files that only
apply to Ms. Pac-Man are in the MsPacMan sub-directory, but others are in 
the root MM-NEAT directory. Here is a list of what each file is used for:

postBestEval.bat		Evaluate champion Ms. Pac-Man net (non-visual) with original settings and save results to eval report in run directory.
postBestFourMazeEval.bat	Evaluate champion Ms. Pac-Man net (non-visual) with FourMaze settings and save results to eval report in run directory.
postBestFourMazeRecord.bat	Watch and record single eval of champion Ms. Pac-Man net with FourMaze settings.
postBestFourMazeWatch.bat	Watch champion Ms. Pac-Man net behavior with FourMaze settings.
postBestMPMvsGEval.bat		Evaluate champion Ms. Pac-Man net (non-visual) with MPMvsG settings and save results to eval report in run directory.
postBestMPMvsGRecord.bat	Watch and record single eval of champion Ms. Pac-Man net with MPMvsG settings.
postBestMPMvsGWatch.bat		Watch champion Ms. Pac-Man net behavior with MPMvsG settings.
postBestObjectiveEval.bat	Evaluate (non-visual) behavior of best nets in each objective with original settings.
postBestObjectiveWatch.bat	Watch behavior of best nets in each objective with original settings.
postBestWatch.bat		Watch champion Ms. Pac-Man net behavior with original settings.
postParetoFrontWatch.bat	Watch behavior of all members of Pareto front using original evaluation settings. Works for domains besides Ms. Pac-Man.
postReplay.bat			Replay any Ms. Pac-Man recording saved by one of the record batch files.

Eval reports are stored in the directory with all other data from the original 
experiment. For example, the MsPacMan-OneLifeConflict-MMD.bat file stores
data in onelifeconflict/MMD0, and the eval report created in this directory
would start OneLifeConflict-MMD0_Eval. Be carefule with eval files: Running a
batch file that creates an eval report will overwrite any existing eval report,
unless you manually change the name of any pre-existing files.

Watching, evaluating, or recording champion performance with original settings
means that the setting will be the same as in the original experiment that created
the champion. FourMaze and MPMvsG rules are specific rule sets that have been used
in the literature before. These rule sets are explained in both the dissertation
and GECCO 2014 paper referenced above.

As you watch a network's behavior, you will also see several other windows. One 
contains the evolved neural network used by the agent. Four narrow windows contain 
the sensor readings corresponding to each direction that Ms. Pac-Man checks when 
moving. Direction 0 is UP, 1 is RIGHT, 2 is DOWN, and 3 is LEFT. These windows also
show the outputs of each network for each direction checked (directions with a wall
simply have no readings). If the network has preference neurons, then the comparative
output of each preference neuron will also be displayed. Additionally, Ms. Pac-Man 
will leave trails of a difference color for each module she uses.

=========== OTHER DOMAINS ===========

This code was primarily developed to evolve Ms. Pac-Man agents, but other domains
are also integrated with the code. Not all domains are fully developed, but much work
has been done since the original work in Ms. Pac-Man.

First, the code is integrated with RL-Glue, which is a system for evaluating
Reinforcement Learning algorithms available here:

http://glue.rl-community.org

You don't need to download any additional files for RL-Glue to work, but the webpage
may provide assistance in understanding how it works. RL-Glue domains
need to be tweaked slightly to work with MM-NEAT, but a few are already functioning:
PuddleWorld, CartPole, MountainCar, and Tetris. Visualization can be viewed if "watch:true" 
is included in the command line. Post visualizations with some of the batch files above
also work (postParetoFrontWatch.bat and postBestObjective*). Most of these domains
have not received much attention, but Tetris is an exception (see publication above). 

If you achieve any interesting results, I would be happy to hear from 
you at schrum2@southwestern.edu.

Another domain included with this code is a 2D reimplementation of the BREVE Monsters
domain, in which many of the methods used in MM-NEAT (Module Mutation, TUG) were first
tested. The original BREVE Monsters can be downloaded at:

http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?brevemonsters

The BREVE 2D domain in MM-NEAT is not identical to BREVE Monsters, but it is similar in 
many ways. The specific domains implemented are Front-Back Ramming (FBR),
Predator/Prey (PP), and Fight or Flight (FoF). Some work is still needed to bring this
code up to the level of the original BREVE Monsters experiments, but you are free to play
with it. Some known issues: monitoring the inputs to the networks causes strange color
clashes, likely because each monster has its own network and is trying to write data to
the same window simultaneously; the sensors don't all work the same as they do in BREVE;
the camera does not follow the agents, so sometimes all the action happens out of sight;
FoF features a ramming orb instead of a bat as in the original BREVE implementation;
and for some reason the dynamics of the FoF don't allow baiting behavior to emerge. Still,
the code is a useful starting point. Some batch files to get you started are in batch/Breve2D/.

The current implementation of these domains produces some different results from those
in the original BREVE Monsters domain. If you manage to produce any interesting results
with this code, or fix any of the issues mentioned above, please let me know by emailing
me at schrum2@southwestern.edu

Other pre-existing domains include a toroidal Predator/Prey grid world, several board games,
Super Mario, and VizDoom. Several ways of interactively creating interesting art and sounds
are also available. Please explore!

=========== MAKING YOUR OWN DOMAINS ===========

All of the pre-existing domains should provide useful examples of how to integrate a new
domain either of your own design, or made by someone else. Here are some general hints
on how to do this.

1) Make your domain implement the Task interface. Specifically, you may want to extend one
   of the classes in the edu.utexas.cs.nn.tasks package that already implements the Task
   interface. LonerTask is appropriate for any task where only a single genotype is evaluated
   at a time. However, if the domain has noisy evaluations, then NoisyLonerTask is more
   appropriate.
2) You may need to set up additional parameters related to your domain in 
   edu.utexas.cs.nn.parameters.Parameters.java.
3) You will need to edit edu.utexas.cs.nn.mmneat.MMNEAT.java so that when the game task
   matches your new task, it prepares evolution to run your domain (for example, by 
   instantiating classes or setting up parameters unique to your domain).

If you integrate any interesting domains into MM-NEAT, I would love to hear about it
by email at schrum2@southwestern.edu. Feel free to contact me for help with integrating
your domains as well.
