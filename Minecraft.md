# Instructions for interacting with the Minecraft server via EvoCraft

Before starting anything, make sure that the correct version of python is installed, and that it is specified in the `my_python_path.txt`. More details on how this is done can be found here: [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md)

### How to launch the Minecraft server

Once python is set up correctly, the Minecraft server needs to be launched and running. To launch the server for the first time, navigate to the `data` sub directory. Once here, you should see the directory `EvoCraft-py`. This should be here on install, but if for whatever reason it isnâ€™t, make a copy of `EvoCraft-py-Backup` and name the copy `EvoCraft-py`. Make sure to keep the backup in the `data` folder.

Once the `EvoCraft-py` has been made, if needed, open the folder. In order to run the server the `eula.txt` needs to be marked as true. On a fresh install, it will not be visible, however, running `LaunchEvoCraftServer.bat` will make it appear (`java -jar minecraft_server.1.12.2.jar` will also make it appear.) Open `eula.txt` and change `eula` from equaling `false` to `true`. Save this, then close the txt file. From here, the server can be launched in a couple of different ways. The easiest way is to run `LaunchEvoCraftServer.bat`. A command window will open and start running. Once a warning about `No rcon password set` is displayed, the server is running! If the server crashes, double check the `eula` is set to `true`, and that there aren't multiple servers running. If multiple servers are running use the command `wmic process where "commandline like '%%java%%sponge%%'" delete` to kill all the currently running servers.

If `LaunchEvoCraftServer.bat` is not in your folder, likely from manually copying over the backup directory, you can also run the server by running it in a PowerShell window. Open the PowerShell while still in the EvoCraft-py folder. Then, you can run `java -jar spongevanilla-1.12.2-7.3.0.jar`, which will launch the server in PowerShell.

### Minecraft game setup
Once the server is running the world starts in survival, and spawns you away from where anything will be generated. So, before any of the shape generating files are run it is helpful to type a few commands to make things easier. In the command window or the Powershell window running the server and type the following commands:

* `/defaultgamemode creative`
* `/gamerule doWeatherCycle false` (keep the weather in one state, then makes the weather clear)
* `/weather clear`
* `/gamerule doDaylightCycle false` (turns off the daylight cycle, then makes it daytime)
* `/time set day`

If you join the server before setting creative mode you can use `/gamemode creative [Your_Minecraft_Username]`.

Once you have the server set up, open Minecraft and join the server. (Your Minercraft needs to have a 1.12 installation, and the direct connect server address is "localhost"). Once you join the world type `/tp [Your_Minecraft_Username] -100 100 -100` which teleports you to the area in which the shapes will be generated. It can also be helpful to `op` yourself by typing `op [Your_Minecraft_Username]` into either the command window or the PowerShell window.

### Running batch files to evolve shapes

Once all of this has been set up, we can start evolving shapes with MAP Elites or MOME! Navigate to the `batch` directory and scroll down to the Minecraft batch files. There should be at least 4 directories, all with "Minecraft" at the start of their name. All of these contain lots of batch files to run, but we'll start with `MinecraftAccumulate-ME-Observer-VectorPistonOrientation.bat` in the `Experiments-2023-GECCO-MinecraftFlyingMachines` directory. Start by launching a PowerShell window, and then typing (or hitting tab) until the desired batch file is chosen. Make sure to type an integer after the file name to give it a seed to generate off of. The command should look something like this in the window: 
* `.\Launch.bat .\MinecraftAccumulate-ME-Observer-VectorPistonOrientation.bat 10`

You can then press enter to run it. The area will be cleared out in Minecraft and shapes will start spawning and being evaluated. If a batch file has the parameters `interactWithMapElitesInWorld` and `minecraftContainsWholeMAPElitesArchive` set to true then several fences will be placed to house the shapes (this can take a few minutes, depending on how large the archive/shapes are). Then, once all of initialization is complete, the bins will be populated with shapes. These shapes are being generated and evaluated a few hundred blocks away, where they are given fitness scores. These scores are compared to the shapes in the archive, and if a shape is deemed as more fit than one of the ones in the archive, it is replaced by the more fit individual. So, as shapes are being generated, better and better shapes are replacing the shapes already in the archive.

With each shape, three blocks are also generated:
* The diamond block, which when broken, regenerates the shape. This is useful for when you either want to see how the shape moves, or if it gets broken
* The emerald block, which when broken, deletes the shape from the archive. This allows a new shape to be added if the current one has become stagnant
* The obsidian block, which when broken, forces new individuals to be produced based on the current shape's makeup. This is useful for when you want more shapes that are similar to an already generated shape.
* Also, a gold block is displayed on any individual(s) which have the highest fitness (denoted as champions). This is just a flag to showcase where the "best" individuals are, and breaking it does not have any effect

From here, all of the other batch files can also be run, which all have different focuses on outcomes.

### Reset server world

If anything happens to the server, or your world, and it needs to be reset, run the batch file `ResetServerWorld.bat`. This will give you a fresh world by copying in the files from the backup directory. Make sure the server is not running when using the reset batch file, otherwise it will not reset. If this does not sufficiently clear the world you can delete all files in `MM-NEAT\data\EvoCraft-py` not ending with ".bat" or ".jar" and then run the `ResetServerWorld.bat` file. This should deal with anything else that might be instantiated.

### Generating and examining resulting shapes

There are various ways to evaluate shapes after an evelotionary run using batch files in the `MM-NEAT` directory. These generate shapes at the `-500 100 500` coordinates and the server must be launched before using them. For evaluating a folder of shapes use `postSpawnMinecraftBlocks.bat` by opening a powershell window and typing `.\postSpawnMinecraftBlocks.bat <filePathToFolder>`. Simply add the path to the folder that contains all the shapes you want to spawn. It will load all the shapes and then you can observe them in Minecraft, using the instructions at the command prompt to cycle through shapes. `postSpawnMinecraftEvaluateBlocksCenterOfMass.bat` and `postSpawnMinecraftEvaluateBlocksMissileCompass.bat` both take directories of shapes as well. To evaluate two shapes side by side use `postSpawnMultipleMinecraftShapes.bat` and list two block list .txt files afterwards. Teleport to `-506 100 520` for best viewing. The shape on the right will be the first file listed and the shape on the left will be the second.

Happy generating!
